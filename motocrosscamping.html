    <h2> A little bit about Motocross and Camping </h2>
    <p> 
      Almost every other weekend my dad, my sister, and I go camping and dirt bike riding.
      My dad has KTM dirtbike, and my sister and I have Polaris quads. We take our trailer up to Gorman, California a lot.
      I enjoy camping a lot more because we get to go riding. When we go to Gorman we go on the quad track and since it's been raining 
      and snowing up north the dirt is moist and we get so muddy! A lot of people would probably get grossed out but I love what I do! 
      Over thanksgiving break, I went to Dove Springs to go riding. It was so fun, I learned how to ride a dirt bike while I was there.
      I like dirtbikes but I loveeee my quad.

    Recently, my family and I went to supercross! Supercross is very fun and entertaining. In this race Ken Roczen #94 
      was in third place in the main race and then BOOM out of nowhere we falls and is out of the race. In a recent article that I read,
      I learned that he may be out for the rest of the season because of broken bones! On a more positive note, my favorite rider
      Ryan Dungey #1 got first place in the last race. Something to know about supercross if you've never heard about it before is that 
      you don't automatically become first place of everyone just because you won a race, you get points for being in first, second, third
      and then at the end of the season they add up the points and that is your number just like how Dungey is #1 because he had the most points
      last season.
