   <h2> My future </h2>
  <article>
	  My future highschool is Lakewood High School and I wish to be in the program, Merit Scholars. The career I wish to pursue is Criminal Law so I wish to attend Harvard University. My overall life goals are to graduate Harvard with my degree in law and become a very good lawyer. After that I want to travel the world and possibly be in the peace corps. Then after that I wish to get married in the Bahamas.

		Something that I also wish to do in the future is to make sure my families legacy of camping and dirt bike riding/ motocross stays present. I wish to have all my kids on a dirt bike or quad. It is something I enjoy and I want my future family to too. Something that I also wish to do with my children in the future is to make sure they get good grades! I want them to enjoy learning and want to learn.
		I also wish to travel a lot with my future husband and future kids because I feel like they should know many cultures and not just their own. Some places I want to go with them are Europe, specifically France and Italy, Austrailia, Hawaii, Bahamas, New York, Rhode Island, Texas, and many many more!
